# uchi-experiments — Compressed Plan

Constraint: RTX 5070 is at 11.2/12.2 GB, 66% util from the live uchi training
(confirmed via `nvidia-smi` on 2026-07-15). Everything below defaults to CPU;
GPU use here is opt-in and capped small, never assumed.

Goal of this plan: a params-vs-loss-vs-tokens scaling law, cheap enough to
run entirely on CPU, that tells us whether MoE / unified multimodal tokens /
factuality training are worth spending real uchi GPU budget on. Not: a
production model.

## Phase A — Harness (blocks everything else)
- [ ] Byte-level or small-BPE tokenizer, single shared vocab (reused later
      for the multimodal token-space test — build it generic from day one,
      but do not build audio/pixel tokenizers yet)
- [ ] Minimal dense Transformer or SSM train loop, CPU-first, device
      auto-detect with a hard VRAM ceiling (e.g. skip GPU entirely unless
      explicitly passed `--device cuda` and `--max-vram-mb` under ~1GB)
- [ ] Loss/perplexity logging per step, checkpointing, deterministic seed,
      hidden-state/activation dumping (needed later for Phase D probes —
      cheap to add now, expensive to retrofit)
- [ ] `--arm` flag with three values, all on the same base model/loop:
      - `base` — plain next-token CE (control)
      - `mtp` — + n extra linear heads predicting t+2..t+n (Gloeckle et al.
        2024, arXiv:2404.19737), heads dropped at inference
      - `jepa-aux` — + projection head and cosine/VICReg loss between two
        *paired* views of the same example (see Phase C — code only)
- [ ] Sanity run: train to near-zero loss on a 3-sentence toy string,
      confirm memorization — proves the loop is correct before spending
      any real compute

## Phase B — Text scaling sweep (Romeo & Juliet)
- [ ] Corpus: public-domain Romeo & Juliet text (~25K tokens)
- [ ] Arms in scope: `base`, `mtp` only — no natural paired second view
      exists in R&J alone, so `jepa-aux` is skipped here (see note above)
- [ ] Train 4 model sizes (e.g. ~50K / 200K / 1M / 5M params) × 2 arms,
      same tokens, same schedule, log final loss + wall-clock + CPU-seconds
- [ ] Fit Kaplan/Chinchilla-style power law L(N, D) per arm; compare
      `mtp` vs `base` at matched params/tokens
- [ ] Held-out lookahead proxy test (small synthetic completions requiring
      a token defined later in the same clause) to check whether `mtp`
      actually reduces teacher-forcing shortcut learning (Bachmann &
      Nagarajan 2024, arXiv:2403.06963), not just lowers loss

## Phase C — Code scaling sweep
- [ ] Small permissively-licensed code corpus (single language, comparable
      token count to Phase B), with natural docstring↔function-body pairs
      preserved — this pairing *is* the second "view" for `jepa-aux`
- [ ] All three arms in scope: `base`, `mtp`, `jepa-aux`
- [ ] Same 4-size sweep, same harness, no architecture changes
- [ ] `jepa-aux` metric: docstring→function nearest-neighbor retrieval
      accuracy in embedding space (did alignment learn shared semantics,
      not just shrink the loss number)
- [ ] Compare fitted exponents and per-arm deltas text vs. code

## Phase D — Combine & estimate
- [ ] For each corpus, keep only arms that beat `base` outside noise at
      matched params/tokens — a dud arm does not get combined
- [ ] If ≥2 arms win on a corpus, train the combined config (`mtp` +
      `jepa-aux` together where both apply) — this is the actual "new
      architecture" candidate, not a fourth independent guess
- [ ] Latent steering probes (TSV/SAE-style, arXiv:2503.01917) on saved
      activations from the winning checkpoint(s) — measured as
      verified-accuracy + abstention-rate shift, never "hallucination-free"
- [ ] From the fitted laws, extrapolate params/compute needed at "real"
      scale (order-of-magnitude), stated against the current GPU's free
      capacity
- [ ] Go/no-go on the backlog below, based on measured numbers, not vibes

## Backlog — explicitly NOT started until Phase D says so
- [ ] MoE routing layer (only if dense sweep shows params-per-FLOP ceiling
      actually binds at the target scale — DeepSeekMoE-style fine-grained
      experts, arXiv:2401.06066)
- [ ] Unified multimodal tokens: EnCodec audio codes / VQGAN pixel tokens
      feeding the same vocab (Chameleon-style, arXiv:2405.09818) — swap
      data source into the *same* harness, do not build new pipelines
- [ ] Paired-view dataset for R&J (paraphrase or line↔scene-summary) if
      `jepa-aux` wins big on code and is worth extending to text
- [ ] Full JEPA-as-primary-objective (no token decoder) — rejected for
      this project, solves a different problem than "predicts the next
      token"; revisit only if the auxiliary-loss version clearly stalls

See [`core_principle.md`](core_principle.md) for why this order and not the
obvious one.
